Our objective is to understand which brand is more discount-friendly, which has a broader product range, how many products they share, and which of their products are highest rated by consumers.\n\nWe will leverage a dataset that provides detailed information on the products offered by both brands, including pricing, product types, and customer reviews. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will scrutinize the data to answer the following key questions:\n\n    Discount Analysis: How do Adidas and Nike compare in terms of their discount strategies? Which brand offers more significant discounts?\n    Product Range: Which brand has a wider variety of products? How does the diversity of their product lineup compare?\n    Common Products: How many products are common to both Adidas and Nike? This will help us understand the overlap in their offerings.\n    Highest Rated Products: By analyzing customer reviews, we will identify the top-rated products from each brand. This will give us insights into the preferences of consumers and the strengths of each brand.\n\nBy the end of this notebook, we aim to provide a comprehensive comparison that can inform strategic decisions for both consumers and stakeholders interested in the sportswear industry.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics
